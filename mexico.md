# La Paz, Mexico

  

My favorite travel destination is La Paz, Mexico. I love this area of the country as the city is rich in cultural history and it is a big marine conservation area. If you love the outdoors, there are many things to do all within a 1-2 hour journey from the city. These include but are not limited too:

* Scuba diving

* Hot springs

* surfing

* Hiking

* kiteboarding

* miles of ATV and dirtbike tracks

  

If you love all things adventure, you will _love_ La Paz, Mexico.
